# SVD-Compression
A MATLAB/Octave implementation of image compression using Singular Value Decomposition SVD.

## Description
This Project demonstrate how SVD can be used for image compression by keeping only the most biggest singular values

## Features
- Image compression using SVD
- Compression ratio analysis
- Visual quality comparison
- Energy capture analysis
